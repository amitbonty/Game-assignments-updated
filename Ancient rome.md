<h1> Ancient Rome </h1>
<h2> Plebeians and Patricians </h2>
<p>The game is set in Ancient rome,where the Roman citizens were divided into two classes, Plebeians and Patricians.
The patricians were the upper class. They were the wealthy land owners.
The plebeians were the lower class. They included everyone who was not a patrician. They were sometimes just called plebs. At one time, plebs were the poor people of ancient Rome. They were the workers. Plebeians and Patricians rarely mixed socially. (Slaves did not count in either group. Some slaves treated well, some treated not so well.)
For a while, it was illegal for a pleb and patrician to marry. Under the Republic, that law was finally changed. Still, marriages between the classes was rare. 
Under the Empire, both classes were similar in what they could do. All free adult males were citizens, no matter what their class.  In both classes, the oldest male was the paterfamilias or head of the family.  Old age was honored, and women had no rights.  If you could afford them, both classes owned slaves.  The houses of both classes were designed the same way unless you were too poor to own your own home.  Everyone worshipped the same gods. They observed the same festivals and holy days.  Everyone spoke Latin and everyone went to the baths and enjoyed the forum.Here the player has the option to choose from either of the two classes which empowers the players with varied attributes.</p>
<h3>1.PATRICIANS</h3>
<p>As stated in the background, Patricians always had more power in Rome than the Plebeians because they were the true desendents of the original people in Rome. Only patricians could become senators and emperors.  So a lot of Patricians shared the rights and responsibilities of the Senate, as they were apart of it. Even though the patricians had more power than the plebeians, they had to be careful. The plebeians had the larger population and could be dangerous if they were angered. To avoid conflict, the patricians gave the plebeians enough rights to make them happy , such as the right to marry patricians or to have financial protection in war , while still keeping most of the power for themselves.

<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
<ul>Care for, and Supervise the land they owned</ul>
<ul>If they were in the Senate, they had the responsibilities of the senate as well</ul>
<h4>Rights</h4>
<ul>Political and Economic advantages,</ul>
<ul>Only people who could become senators</ul>
<ul>Could make laws to go to the assembly</ul>

<h3>2.PLEBEIANS</h3>
<p>Plebeians did not have much power in Rome, even though they made up most of the Roman population. They did fight for more power and rights in Rome, mostly through riots or strikes. In the Conflict of Orders (Roman Republic), the Plebeians refused to fight in the Roman army until they were insured that their land and property would be protected. After the patricians had agreed to this, they joined the army only to find that the agreements had not been kept. After a few occurences like this, Patricians finally created decemviri, so that the people of Rome would understand their rights and laws. Soon after, Rome's Twelve Tables were created. The Twelve tables were a group of people who  created the laws for the different social classes of Rome.They did earn more power this way, however the main leadership in Rome always laid in the patrician class. It was very uncommon for the Plebeians to flourish in politics.

<h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>Fight in the Roman army</ul>
<ul>Many worked the Patricians land</ul>
<h4>Rights:</h4>
<p>Plebeians did not have many rights, as they were considered "common folk". However they did strike and petition to change their status and eventually were able to participate in politics.
<h3>LIFE TOGETHER</h3>
<p>Plebeians and Patricians had many differences. Their rights and responsibilities, their levels of power, and their populations were very different.  Patricians wanted to keep most of the power for themselves but they needed the Plebeians in order to do it. Working as foot soldiers, Plebeians fought many of Rome's battles and expanded Rome, therefore, expanding the influence Patricians had on people. Plebeians had the larger population, so the Patricians had to be careful to give them some power so that they wouldn't riot or refuse to fight their wars. Patricians in a way were probably resented for their power, and Plebeians were most likely feared by the Patricians for their power in numbers. Being a Plebeian or a Patrician was based on family relations, which is why in the earlier days of Rome, Plebeians and Patricians could not marry each other. Patricians later changed this law to get the Plebeians to fight in their wars. This new law allowed Plebeians to marry into a better social class.</p>
Depending on the decisions made by the players of the various events his outcome on on different attributes and position in society is established.</p>
